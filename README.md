# react-native-skeleton

This is my skeleton for my react-native projects. Have fun.

## Rename

Use [react-native-rename](https://github.com/junedomingo/react-native-rename) to rename this project.

## Adjustments

You need to change/remove the `KEYSTORE_PROPERTIES` in the `android/gradle.properties` file as you like.

## Project

The code will be formatted with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) before every git commit with the help of [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

### Android

- Using proguard for debug and release builds.
- Using latest stable android sdk build tools.

### iOS

- Nothing to mention yet.

## TODO

- Use [flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow)

## Contributions

If you have any suggestions for improvements or issues with this skeleton, let me know :)
